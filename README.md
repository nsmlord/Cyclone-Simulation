# Simulating Mid-Latitude Cyclones using the Shallow Water Model

Welcome to the official repository for **Simulating Mid-Latitude Cyclones using the Shallow Water Model**!

This project models the dynamics of mid-latitude cyclones by solving the shallow water equations on a rotating sphere. The simulation explores cyclone evolution under varying physical parameters such as friction, solar forcing, and fluid depth.

For a full technical explanation, detailed methodology, validation, and analysis, **please refer to the accompanying research paper**:  
ðŸ“„ **SMLRCSWM Documentation**.

## Repository Structure

- **`textures/`**  
  Contains `.jpg` images of the Earth used for rendering during the simulation.

- **`results/`**  
  Stores simulation output such as diagnostic data, figures, and screenshots used in the research paper.

- **`sources/`**
  - **`source_old/`**  
    Early prototypes and developmental versions of the simulation.
  - **`source_current/`**  
    Main project code.

## Important Files

- **`cyclone_sim_varnormalV2.m`**  
  The latest and best version of the simulation model.  
  âž” This file includes both **validation mode** and **study mode** (see SMLRCSWM Documentation for details).

- **`*_nonnormalVX.m` Files**  
  Older versions where velocity values were not normalized. These are mainly for historical reference or exploratory purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nsmlord/Cyclone-Simulation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `sources/source_current/` folder.
3. Open and run **`cyclone_sim_varnormalV2.m`** in MATLAB.
4. Adjust parameters for validation or study mode as explained in the SMLRCSWM Documentation.
